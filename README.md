# What's up? 👋 
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! Here's a small blurb about me. 😄

I formerly interned at Microsoft within the **Garage Internship** and **Xbox Game Studios**. Check out **[Device Simulator Express](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-devicesimulator)**, my Garage Internship project! It's a handy dandy tool for simulating microcontrollers. 💡📲💼 

I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** at the **University of British Columbia**. Take a look at this [cool computer vision-based license plate identifier](https://github.com/andreamah/License-Plate-Identifier) that I'm making for a project course! 👀 

I like strumming my ukelele and playing Animal Crossing. 🎸🎧🎮 I'm also an advocate for **Girls in STEM**, **Widespread STEM Literacy**, and **Accessibility in Gaming** (to name a few)! Also passionate about learning new things about software development ~~even if it creates an onslaught of failure and getting back up again~~. 😅

Thanks for visiting my profile! Catch me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-mah/)** for more info about my professional experience. 😁
