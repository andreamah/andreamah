# What's up? 👋 
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! Here's a small rambly blurb about me. 😄

I formerly interned at Microsoft within the **Garage Internship** and **Xbox Game Studios**. Check out [Device Simulator Express](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-devicesimulator), my Garage Internship project! It's a handy dandy tool for simulating microcontrollers. 💡📲💼 

I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** at the **University of British Columbia**. Check out this [cool computer vision-based license plate identifier](https://github.com/andreamah/License-Plate-Identifier) that I'm making for a project course! 👀 

I like strumming my ukelele and playing Animal Crossing. 🎸🎧🎮 I'm also an advocate for *Girls in STEM*, *Widespread STEM Literacy*, and *Accessibility in Gaming* (to name a few)!
